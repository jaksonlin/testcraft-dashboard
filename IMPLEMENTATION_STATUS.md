## 🔧 Admin Guide

### Database Migration

```bash
# Run Flyway migration to create indexes
./mvnw flyway:migrate

# Verify indexes created
psql -d testcraft_db -c "
  SELECT indexname, tablename 
  FROM pg_indexes 
  WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename IN ('test_methods', 'test_classes', 'repositories', 'teams')
  ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
"

# Should see 11+ indexes
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Check slow queries in PostgreSQL
psql -d testcraft_db -c "
  SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time 
  FROM pg_stat_statements 
  WHERE query LIKE '%test_methods%'
  ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
  LIMIT 10;
"

# All queries should be <100ms with indexes
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: Slow queries**
```sql
-- Check if indexes are being used
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT ... FROM test_methods ... 
WHERE team_name = 'Engineering';

-- Look for "Index Scan" not "Seq Scan"
-- If "Seq Scan" appears, indexes aren't being used
```

**Issue: Wrong statistics**
```bash
# Verify global stats endpoint works
curl http://localhost:8090/api/dashboard/test-methods/stats/global

# Should return accurate totals
```

**Issue: Hierarchy not loading**
```bash
# Test hierarchy endpoint
curl http://localhost:8090/api/dashboard/test-methods/hierarchy?level=TEAM

# Should return list of teams with stats
```
