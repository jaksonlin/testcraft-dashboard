# Flyway Migration Fix

## ‚ùå Problem

Spring Boot's Flyway auto-configuration wasn't running because:
1. Project uses custom `DatabaseConfig` with `database.properties`
2. Spring Boot's Flyway auto-config expects datasource in `application.yml`
3. Mismatch between configuration sources

## ‚úÖ Solution

Created `FlywayConfig.java` that:
1. Uses the existing `DataSource` bean from `SpringDatabaseConfig`
2. Manually configures Flyway with correct settings
3. Uses `@Bean(initMethod = "migrate")` to auto-run migrations on startup

## üîß How It Works

```java
@Bean(initMethod = "migrate")  // ‚Üê Automatically calls flyway.migrate() after bean creation
public Flyway flyway(DataSource dataSource) {
    return Flyway.configure()
        .dataSource(dataSource)
        .locations("classpath:db/migration")
        .baselineOnMigrate(true)  // Works with existing database
        .load();
}
```

When Spring Boot starts:
1. Creates `DataSource` bean (from `SpringDatabaseConfig`)
2. Creates `Flyway` bean (from `FlywayConfig`)  
3. Calls `flyway.migrate()` automatically (initMethod)
4. Runs pending migrations (V2__create_test_cases_tables.sql)
5. Creates test_cases tables

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Restart Spring Boot
2. Watch for Flyway logs during startup
3. Tables will be created automatically
4. Page will work!

## Expected Logs

You should see:
```
üîÑ Configuring Flyway for database migrations...
‚úÖ Flyway configured successfully
Flyway Community Edition x.x.x by Redgate
Database: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/test_analytics
Successfully validated 2 migrations (execution time 00:00.010s)
Current version of schema "public": 1
Migrating schema "public" to version "2 - create test cases tables"
Successfully applied 1 migration to schema "public"
```

If version is already 2, you'll see:
```
Schema "public" is up to date. No migration necessary.
```

Both are success! ‚úÖ
