# Sample Repository List for Annotation Extractor
# Add your git repository URLs here, one per line
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Empty lines are also ignored

# Example repositories (replace with your actual repositories):
# https://github.com/example/repo1.git
# https://github.com/example/repo2
# git@github.com:example/repo3.git

# For testing purposes, you can use these public repositories:
# https://github.com/junit-team/junit4.git
# https://github.com/mockito/mockito.git
# https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest.git
