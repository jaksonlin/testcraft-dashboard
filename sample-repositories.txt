# Sample Repository List for Annotation Extractor
# Add your git repository URLs here, one per line
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Empty lines are also ignored

# Note: This file now supports both SSH and HTTPS URLs
# SSH URLs (git@github.com:username/repo.git) will use SSH authentication
# HTTPS URLs will use username/password if provided, or no auth for public repos

# Example repositories (replace with your actual repositories):
# https://github.com/example/repo1.git
# https://github.com/example/repo2
# git@github.com:example/repo3.git

# For testing purposes, you can use these public repositories:
# https://github.com/junit-team/junit4.git
# https://github.com/mockito/mockito.git
# https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest.git

# Your repositories (using SSH URLs for SSH authentication):
git@github.com:jaksonlin/testcraft-dashboard.git
git@github.com:jaksonlin/db2h2.git

# Note: For SSH authentication, you can either:
# 1. Use default SSH configuration (ssh-agent, ~/.ssh/id_rsa, etc.):
#    java RepositoryHubRunner ./repos ./repo-list.txt
# 2. Specify a specific SSH key:
#    java RepositoryHubRunner ./repos ./repo-list.txt ~/.ssh/github_key
# 3. Use HTTPS with username/password:
#    java RepositoryHubRunner ./repos ./repo-list.txt myuser mytoken
