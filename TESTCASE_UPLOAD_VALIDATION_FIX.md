# Test Case Upload - Validation Fix

## Problem

Even though the UI showed "✓ Using values from Excel" for organization mapping, clicking the Import button still showed the error modal: **"Please select an organization before importing"**.

## Root Cause

The validation logic was in two places:
1. **Button disabled state** in `PreviewStep.tsx` ✅ (was working correctly)
2. **Import handler validation** in `useTestCaseUpload.ts` ❌ (was not checking mappings)

The `handleImport` function was checking:
```typescript
if (!organization || organization.trim() === '') {
  alert('Please select an organization before importing');
  return;
}
```

But when organization is mapped in Excel, the `organization` state is empty because we're supposed to use Excel values, not the manual input.

## Solution

Updated the validation logic in `useTestCaseUpload.ts` to check if organization is mapped in Excel:

```typescript
// Check if organization is mapped in Excel
const hasOrganizationMapping = Object.values(mappings).includes('organization');

// Validate organization is selected (only if not mapped in Excel)
if (!hasOrganizationMapping && (!organization || organization.trim() === '')) {
  alert('Please select an organization before importing');
  return;
}
```

## How It Works Now

### If Organization is Mapped in Excel:
- `hasOrganizationMapping` = `true`
- Validation is skipped (no alert)
- Import proceeds using Excel organization values

### If Organization is NOT Mapped in Excel:
- `hasOrganizationMapping` = `false`
- Validation checks if manual organization is entered
- Shows alert if organization field is empty
- Import proceeds using manual organization value

## Files Changed

- ✏️ `frontend/src/components/testcases/upload/useTestCaseUpload.ts`
  - Updated `handleImport` function validation logic
  - Added `hasOrganizationMapping` check

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Organization Mapped in Excel
1. Upload Excel with organization column
2. Map organization column in Mapping step
3. Preview step shows: ✓ "Using values from Excel"
4. Click Import button
5. **Expected**: Import proceeds without validation error

### Test Case 2: Organization NOT Mapped (Empty DB)
1. Upload Excel without organization column
2. Don't map organization in Mapping step
3. Preview step shows: Text input field
4. Leave organization field empty
5. Click Import button
6. **Expected**: Shows alert "Please select an organization before importing"

### Test Case 3: Organization NOT Mapped (Manual Entry)
1. Upload Excel without organization column
2. Don't map organization in Mapping step
3. Preview step shows: Text input field
4. Type "MyCompany" in organization field
5. Click Import button
6. **Expected**: Import proceeds using "MyCompany"
